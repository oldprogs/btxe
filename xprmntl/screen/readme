They should compile with Watcom 1.6 (OS/2 and DOS?). If you want to port them
to another OS (BTW: DOS isn't finished yet), simply have a look at scrndos.h.
Only the 4 Vio* functions need to be ported. Create a scrn<OS>.h and include it
like scrndos.h in screen.h. That's it!

BTW: The list template will be replaced, TJW is writting a better one; mine was
a 5 minutes very quick and dirty hack ;)
