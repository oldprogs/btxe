
this is an attempt to somewhat reduce problems by unifying
compiler dependend type sizes.

-   typesize.h: to be dropped into .\include and included in
                .\include\includes.h for compiler specific
                type/size definitions. please use the common
                definitions in it for the future.

-   typesize.c: small program to determine the typesizes of your
                specific compiler. please add this compiler to
                typesize.h if not already present there.

Comment of TJW:

At first, please change these files misc\* ONLY - do NOT change BT-XE source
code itself.

Later, we should do this mega-change in BT-XE source within one diff - with
no other changes - so that we can locate errors easily.

While doing this change, there should be no other development activity because
after this "type" diff all other diffs based on older source are very probably
rejected by patch.exe, because of the lots of changes done ...
