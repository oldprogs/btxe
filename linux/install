   cat Makefile|tr -d "\r">makefile

1. Setup Makefile:
   - Adjust BINDIR (binaries), MANDIR (man-page) and CONFDIR (binkley.lng)
   - If you don't use husky/fidoconfig (free fidonet software for linux, see
     http://fidosoft.sar-gmbh.com/) or don't want Binkley to use part of its
     config, disable USE_FIDOCONFIG. If the path with Binks sources is not
     located in the same directory as husky, you have to adjust the paths
     to fidoconfig and smapi (unless you copied their header-files to
     /usr/local/bin/ or similar).
   - Enable USE_ALTCHAR, if you want to (to change this later, you only need
     to remove vfos_lnx.o and start make again). This makes btxe use an
     alternative ("system-native") charset on the console.

2. run make (ncurses required, curses may also work (but are not tested), if
   neccessary remove the "n" from the makefile)

3. become root and run make install, if you want the language-file to be
   installed automatically, make installlng

4. write config-file. There are very few differences to BTXEs for other OSs:
   - TimeSync is disabled at the moment
   - MaxPort is disabled
   - Port has to be used like: Port /dev/ttyS1
   - external language file is loaded from the same path as the
     config-file, when its name is passed via command-line with path,
     otherwise from binkley.lng in the current path
     if you use fidoconfig, the default-path is the path where your config
     for fidoconfig is.
   - default config-filename is binkley.cfg (in current path), or, if you
     are using fidoconfig, binkley (loaded from the same path as your
     fidoconfig).
   - default event-filename is binkley.evt (in current path, or, if your are
     using fidoconfig, form the same path as your fidoconfig).
   - If you use fidoconfig, you don't have to (but you may to add information)
     use these keywords in binkley.cfg:
     System, Sysop, Location, Address, Outbound/Hold, Inbound,
     ProtInbound, KnownInbound, Nodelist, StatusLog and NetMail.

   I recommend the following for a system-wide installation of binkley:

   If you are NOT using fidoconfig:
   - Put binkley.cfg, binkley.evt and binkley.lng into /etc/fido/
   - Add EventFile /etc/fido/binkley.evt to your configuration
   - start binkley with
     btxe config /etc/fido/binkley.cfg task=1 binkley=/var/spool/fido/binkley/

   If you are using fidoconfig:
   - Name your config binkley (without .cfg), and put it and binkley.evt and
     binkley.lng in the same directory where your config for fidoconfig is
   - start binkley with
     btxe task=1 binkley=/var/spool/fido/binkley/

   some other differences, that have nothing to do with the config-file, but
   should be listed somewhere:
   - You may use alt-cursor to scroll in the recent activity (if ctrl-cursor
     does not work; alt-cursor probably won't work, neither). If other keys
     work depends on your terminal, too.
   - "dos"shell (alt-j) is broken
