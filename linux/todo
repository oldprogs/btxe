- Test transfer protocols. Hydra and ZedZap seem to be ok now.
- not implemented yet: timesync (misc.c)
- files are opened from the outbound using a filename with fix upper/lower
  characters. all of them should be lowered, this seems to be used for
  binkley outbounds under linux. (most of them should be lowercase now)
- Function-Keys with shift and cursor keys with control do not work
  probably the whole get_key (asyn_lnx.c) should be rewritten.
- No bold background colors available. All color combinations < 128 should
  work. (will wait for the new screen-class before spending any further
  thoughts on this).
- Find out, whether nodelist-files are upper or lowercase. Currently
  they are read lowercase.
- Make other imporant structures portable
- Fix or disable DosShell (alt-j)
