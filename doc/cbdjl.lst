Canonical Binkley-XE Developers Joke List
=========================================

Maintained by tom schlangen @ 2:2450/10

This list contains some jokes and stories which emerged during the
development of BT-XE in the BINKLEY.DEVELOP conference since approx
01/01/97. While most of them probably only make sense in the context
of the developers conference, they certainly show that fido (and work
upon fido-related software) may be fun :-)

#2     | Robert Hoerner to Thomas Waldmann on the subject of which
       | CSD-level (at least) to use with IBM VAC++:
       |
       | ---[quote on]---
       | Right.
       | Minimum for VAC is CTC303.
       | All prior versions sometimes produce their own code ,)
       | depending on the wether of last week.

#3     | tom schlangen on what to display in a mailer screen window which 
       | eventually became empty & useless:
       |
       | ---[quote on]---
       | i would suggest something more interesting, e.g displaying strings
       | like this randomly:
       |
       | "Formatting Drive C: in progress, please stand by."
       | "All passwords of all links succesfully sent to remote."
       | "Modem overheat warning  - fallback to 300 bps initiated."
       | "Exporting private netmail folder to uplink."
       | "Requesting complete remote filebase - press <ctrl-alt-del>
       |  to terminate."
       | "Honoring CIA-initiated user base download request."
       |  (change CIA to BND in german language texts)

#MCD   | tom schlangen to Robert Hoerner on the subject of mad compilers:
       |
       | ---[quote on]---
       | > the compiler completely forgot what it did before.
       |
       | what you reported is something commonly known as `MCD' ("Mad
       | Compiler Disease"). british health authorities strictly deny any
       | connection to `CJS' (the where is my "Cask of Jolt-Syndrome")
       | which quite often happens during `MDS' ("Marathon Debug Sessions").
       |
       | you obviously don't read the newspapers or watch news on tv, since
       | these medias have been full of this stuff during the last year
       | (and probably will be full of it the next ten years, too).

#V7+   | tom schlangen about his tries to find a bug in V7+ code:
       |
       | ---[quote on]---
       | so i prepared for a long debugging night by buying a sixpack of jolt
       | cola (at least there is a legend to maintain about that
       | extra caffeine added stuff) and  activated that dreaded `plus'
       | argument behind the `version7' keyword in my mailer cfg, which
       | guaranteed to crash my emx compiled binaries since approx a year, or
       | something like that.
       |
       |     guess what? yeah, right.
       |
       | it worked flawlessly. no trap, no popup log, no core dump. each and
       | everything works fine, including extended nodelist lookup/info on
       | systems.
       |
       | must be by a pure accident, i though to myself, and step by step
       | cycled thru compiling and testing the last two dozend weeks
       | nodediffs/lists. no crash. nil. nada. and no, i didn't sell my soul
       | to the devil since the last attemp i made with v7+ activated.
       |
       |     tom "feverishly awaiting this weeks nodediff" schlangen
       |
       | p.s.:       the only guess i still have is, that this strange
       |             behaviour is somewhat connected to what's pending in the
       |             outbound exactly (e.g how many files, bytes, nodes,
       |             zones, whatever).
       |
       | p.p.s.:     yes, i am positively sure that there really _is_ a bug
       |             somewhere in the v7+ handling code.
       |
       | p.p.p.s:    in memoriam Frank Zappa: "Now you see it - now you
       |             don't."
       |
       | p.p.p.p.s:  this msg is part of the illuminati conspiration.
