Programmer's hints for BT-XE:

Functions making life easier:
=============================

char *strntcpy(char *destination, char *source, size_t count) [misc.c]

Please use this function as it is safer than strcpy (it will only copy
count characters) and more comfortable/safe than strncpy (it will terminate
destination string at destination[count-1] with '\0').
Just give char array size as count parameter.

time_t age_seconds(time_t timestamp) [misc.c]

Please use this function for age calculations with unix timestamps.
Underflow (happens if you want to know how old future is) is catched and gives
result==0.
