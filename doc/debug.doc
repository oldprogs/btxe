Using debug.c and debug.h for file and memory debugging:

You need to compile with DEBUG #defined for bt's files except btutil's files
(this is a bit difficult as common.c is part of both programs).

Also you have to have debug.c/h in your makefile, of course.

Then you'll find dbgalloc.lxx and dbgfiles.lxx in current directory (attention,
these files grow FAST!!!) giving you some overview over:

dbgalloc.lxx : calls to malloc, calloc, free

dbgfiles.lxx : calls to fopen, share_fopen, fclose
