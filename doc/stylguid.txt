Layout: 

 - Please use GNU indent 1.9.1 or higher.

 - All *.c and *.h files in a directory containing a GNU indent profile
   (.indent.pro) are checked.

 - Hint: Use "diff -c source.c~ source.c" to see if indent worked nicely. It
         has some flaws, i.e. when using special kind of block comments or
         '//'. Please work around those flaws and iterate the indent / diff
         process until everything looks fine.


Some additional rules:

 - Don't use TABs!

 - Only use printable ASCII codes (32 - 126).

 - Comments:

    - Use /* */ and not // as indent has some problems with //.

    - No "} /* end<whatever> */" comments as they are useless. If you think
      you need them because it's getting confusing, consider rewriting /
      splitting!

 - Size:

    - Keep methodes / functions as small and compact as possible, i.e. not
      longer then 100 lines.

    - Create simple, specific, small c / cpp files.

 - Statement Grouping:

    - Group statements together that belong logically together. Use single
      empty lines to create those groups.

    - After a closing brace } leave an empty line; exception: if the following
      statement belongs to the block, i.e.:

        do
        {
          i = dosomething (i);
        }
        while (i != 0);

        if (j == 0)
          dosomethingelse (i);

        while (i > 0)
        {
          i = dosomething (i);
        }

        if (j == 0)
          dosomethingelse (i);

 - Other rules:

    - No assignments in boolean expressions, i.e.
      if ((fp = fopen(...)) != NULL) shoud NOT be used!

    - Avoid "goto"s where ever possible

    - Put OS specific routines in seperate files to avoid #ifdefs.

    - Don't use #defines for macros or constants.

    - Use fopen() instead of open() and use mode parameters defined in
      include/file_all.h.


That's it. Please follow these rules to make the source code easier to read.
If you're not happy with these rules, feel free to contact me (mr@uue.org) and
tell me, what you don't like. If you find typos or other bugs, tell me also.
