Watcom C/C++ 10.x TZ setting
============================

Example for Germany:

TZ=CET-1CST,M3.5.0/02:00:00,M10.5.0/03:00:00
     Example for Germany (should be valid in the whole EU). Daylight saving
     time starts on the last (5) Sunday (0) of March (4) at 2:00 and ends on
     the last (5) Sunday (0) of October (10) at 3:00.

Tip: If you're running other apps that need TZ, too, but use the other format
     (i.e. VAC++ apps) and if you don't care about the exact time between last
     Sunday of March and first Sunday of April, only use TZ=CET-1CST.


The TZ environment variable is used to establish the local time zone. The
value of the variable is used by various time functions to compute times
relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) (formerly known as Greenwich Mean
Time (GMT)).

The time on the computer should be set to the local time. Use the DOS time
command and the DOS date command if the time is not automatically maintained
by the computer hardware.

The TZ environment variable can be set (before the program is executed) by
using the DOS set command as follows:

          SET TZ=PST8PDT

The value of the TZ environment variable should be set as follows (spaces are
for clarity only):

  std offset dst offset , rule


The expanded format is as follows:

  stdoffset[dst[offset][,start[/time],end[/time]]]


std, dst
     three or more letters that are the designation for the standard (std) or
     summer (dst) time zone. Only std is required. If dst is omitted, then
     summer time does not apply in this locale. Upper- and lowercase letters
     are allowed. Any characters except for a leading colon (:), digits, comma
     (,), minus (-), plus (+), and ASCII NUL (\0) are allowed.


offset
     indicates the value one must add to the local time to arrive at
     Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The  offset has the form:

     hh[:mm[:ss]]

     The minutes (mm) and seconds (ss) are optional. The hour (hh) is required
     and may be a single digit. The offset following std is required. If no
     offset follows dst, summer time is assumed to be one hour ahead of
     standard time. One or more digits may be used; the value is always
     interpreted as a decimal number. The hour may be between 0 and 24, and the
     minutes (and seconds) - if present - between 0 and 59. If preceded by a
     "-", the time zone will be east of the Prime Meridian; otherwise it will
     be west (which may be indicated by an optional preceding "+").

rule
     indicates when to change to and back from summer time.  The rule has the
     form:

     date/time,date/time

     where the first date describes when the change from standard to summer
     time occurs and the second date describes when the change back happens.
     Each time field describes when, in current local time, the change to the
     other time is made.

     The format of date may be one of the following:

     Jn
               The Julian day n (1 <= n <= 365). Leap days are not counted.
               That is, in all years - including leap years - February 28 is
               day 59 and March 1 is day 60. It is impossible to explicitly
               refer to the occasional February 29.

     n
               The zero-based Julian day (0 <= n <= 365). Leap years are
               counted, and it is possible to refer to February 29.

     Mm.n.d
               The d'th day (0 <= d <= 6) of week n of month m of the year
               (1 <= n <= 5, 1 <= m <= 12, where week 5 means "the last d day
               in month m" which may occur in the fourth or fifth week). Week 1
               is the first week in which the d'th day occurs. Day zero is
               Sunday.

     The time has the same format as offset except that no leading sign ("+" or
     "-") is allowed. The default, if time is omitted, is 02:00:00.

Some examples are:

TZ=EST5EDT
     Eastern Standard Time is 5 hours earlier than Coordinated Universal Time
     (UTC). Standard time and daylight saving time both apply to this locale.
     By default, Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) is one hour ahead of standard time
     (i.e., EDT4). Since it is not specified, daylight saving time starts on
     the first Sunday of April at 2:00 A.M. and ends on the last Sunday of
     October at 2:00 A.M. This is the default when the TZ variable is not set.

TZ=EST5EDT4,M4.1.0/02:00:00,M10.5.0/02:00:00
     This is the full specification for the default when the TZ variable is not
     set. Eastern Standard Time is 5 hours earlier than Coordinated Universal
     Time (UTC). Standard time and daylight saving time both apply to this
     locale. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) is one hour ahead of standard time.
     Daylight saving time starts on the first (1) Sunday (0) of April (4) at
     2:00 A.M. and ends on the last (5) Sunday (0) of October (10) at 2:00 A.M.

TZ=PST8PDT
     Pacific Standard Time is 8 hours earlier than Coordinated Universal Time
     (UTC). Standard time and daylight saving time both apply to this locale.
     By default, Pacific Daylight Time is one hour ahead of standard time
     (i.e., PDT7). Since it is not specified, daylight saving time starts on
     the first Sunday of April at 2:00 A.M. and ends on the last Sunday of
     October at 2:00 A.M.

TZ=NST3:30NDT1:30
     Newfoundland Standard Time is 3 and 1/2 hours earlier than Coordinated
     Universal Time (UTC). Standard time and daylight saving time both apply
     to this locale. Newfoundland Daylight Time is 1 and 1/2 hours earlier than
     Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

TZ=Central Europe Time-2:00
     Central European Time is 2 hours later than Coordinated Universal Time
     (UTC). Daylight saving time does not apply in this locale.
