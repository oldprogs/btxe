Hints on compiling Binkley-XE/2 with Watcom 11.0
------------------------------------------------

Binkley will compile (and run) using watcom10.* under Watcom 11.0 if you
are aware of a few things I have discovered over the last 3 weeks:

You need to disable outbound caching (line 311 in watcom10.mif) in order
for binkley to load.  If not, it will crash before displaying the WFC
screen.

I have only succesfully compiled and ran the 386 version using maxcomm.
The 486 version crashes before displaying the WFC.

If you are using playing wave (sound) files for events (bbs user, fax,
etc), they will crash binkley when play (I don't not know why yet).

the DOS version won't compile overlays because it seems that wlink does not
support overlays? :-/

Other than that, it works great.
